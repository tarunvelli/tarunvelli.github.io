# Initial server setup

Before installing specific software it's recomended to perform some initial server setup steps like user and firewall setup to ensure a secure environment.

- [Detailed steps](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-22-04)

The server might come with Nano for text editing, but as everyone knows Vim is the best text editor.

```

open .zshrc in vim and change theme to oxide

# Nginx

Use Nginx as a reverse proxy to map subdomains to ports

- Install nginx

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install nginx
```

- Allow through firewall

```
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

-  Server block without TLS/SSL

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name <subdomain.domain.tld>;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass         "http://127.0.0.1:<port>";
    }
}
```

- After running certbot

```
server {
    server_name <subdomain.domain.tld>;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass         "http://127.0.0.1:<port>";
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<subdomain.domain.tld>/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<subdomain.domain.tld>/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = <subdomain.domain.tld>) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


    listen 80;
    server_name <subdomain.domain.tld>;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```
